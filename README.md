# What is this?
A small program to generate static assets (html, CSS, js) for an FAA charts quick reference page. Inspired by https://charts.bvartcc.com/, using data and charts from https://www.aviationapi.com/.

The ZOA version is hosted via Cloudflare Pages at https://charts.oakartcc.org/

# What is this built with?
* F#
* [Giraffe.ViewEngine](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe.ViewEngine) for the HTML templates and rendering directly in F#
* Tailwind for CSS

# How can I build locally?
If you are on Windows, use `build-local.ps1` which will build and place the output files in a `_public` folder. You will need to already have the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/visual-studio-sdks) installed on your machine.

# How can I deploy my own on Cloudflare Pages?
1. Fork the repo to your own account/organization
2. Edit the airports in `site_config.yaml`, split into `Bravo`, `Charlie`, `Delta` and `Echo` categories
3. Set up a Cloudflare Pages app that is connected to your forked repo. Use `chmod +x ./build-cloudflare.sh; ./build-cloudflare.sh` as the build command and `/output/wwwroot` as the output directory
4. If you'd like, follow https://www.codemzy.com/blog/scheduling-builds-cloudflare to set up a daily cron so that your site we re-build with the latest charts daily, except replace the Cloudflare Worker code with the following for Cloudflare's newer ES format (and don't forget to insert your own Cloudflare Pages deploy hook)
```js
export default { 
  async scheduled(event, env, ctx) {
    let deployHook = "YOUR DEPLOY HOOK URL HERE";
    await fetch(deployHook, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
    });
    return "Called deploy hook!"
  },
};
```

# How can I edit the styling (font, colors, etc.)?
The project uses Tailwind CSS. You can edit the styling via the classes in `style.css` using Tailwind's `@apply` directive. The included build scripts will build the final output css from this input file.
